## What is it?
The Interlock Actuator can signal axis positions or lock dangerous axis movement. 

Use cases:
* Actuate pneumatic nozzles up/down based on a virtual Z axis.
* Prevent X, Y movement as long as a sensor indicates that the nozzles are not retracted.
* Prevent X, Y movement as long as a sensor indicates that a drag pin is not retracted, as it should.
* Unlock a machine door when axes are parked. 
* Prevent axis movement when a door is sensed unlocked. 
* etc.
