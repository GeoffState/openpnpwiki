# Your First Pull Request

A step by step tutorial to help new contributors submit their first pull request. By the end of this tutorial you will have a basic understanding of Git, Github and Pull Requests.

# Why Pull Requests?

OpenPnP, and many other Open Source projects maintain their source code and project files in a Git repository. Git is a version control system which allows people to keep track of changes to files over time. The benefit of using a version control system is that you can go back in time and see every change that has ever been made to a project. This is very helpful when trying to find bugs.

A Pull Request is the Git way of asking the maintainer of a project to accept some changes you'd like to make. In most projects there is a small team of maintainers who do development and accept changes from other people. They make sure the changes fit into the architecture of the program and help to catch problems before they are distributed to users.

# A Bit About Github

Github is the most popular Git hosting platform in the world. At it's heart it is a way to manage one or more Git repositories but it also adds very useful things like issue tracking, wiki Pages, collaboration and web based code viewing. Git and Github are separate things. Git is the version control system and Github is a very nice front end for using Git.

Before we get started, you'll need a Github account. It's free and only takes a second to sign up. Once you have one you can contribute to OpenPnP, create your own repositories, file issues and bug reports, create wiki pages and all kinds of stuff.
