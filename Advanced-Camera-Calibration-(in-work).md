# Purpose
The purpose of advanced camera calibration is to:
1. Determine the relative location and orientation of the camera
1. Determine the scaling of machine units to camera pixels, i.e., units per pixel and how it varies with machine Z
1. Correct for imperfections in how the camera is mounted, i.e., rotation from ideal about the X, Y and Z axis
1. Correct for lens imperfections, i.e., barrel/pincushion and tangential distortion
