LitePlacer is "The Low Cost Prototype Builderâ€™s Pick and Place Machine". It's an affordable, open source pick and place machine that you can buy right now in kit form. The LitePlacer software is very good and is designed to work specifically with the machine. You can also run OpenPnP to control the LitePlacer. OpenPnP does not integrate with LitePlacer as well as the LitePlacer software, but it does offer some additional features such as bottom vision.

To use OpenPnP with LitePlacer you have to physically switch the zmin and zmax limit switch wires on the included TinyG and then you can use [[GcodeDriver]] to power the machine. A LitePlacer forum user named sebastian has provided instructions and a sample configuration file at https://wiki.apertus.org/index.php/Liteplacer_PnP_Machine_Notes#OpenPnP_Setup.
