### What is it?

Rapid Feeder is a new type of automatic feeder developed by and soon available at [Deltaprintr.com](deltaprintr.com). It's small, compact and very precise, capable of handling up to 0402 components and supports all tape widths up to 2mm pitch. Each feeder has a UUID address that's also readable on the QR sticker on the top and the side of the feeder. As a result, each feeder has a unique address that's pre-set by Deltaprintr.

2. Forward/reverse buttons on the feeder allow easy loading and unloading of tape.
3. LED indicators on feeder for error (red), forward (green), reverse (white) and actively pulling cover (yellow).
4. UUID address for each feeder. Can also be used for user's own data logging system to keep track of parts inventory by scanning the QR.

6. Reset button on feeder or optionally undock and re-dock the feeder.
