# Actuators and Other Head Objects
Actuators are generic devices you can attach to your machine to do additional tasks not covered by Nozzles and Cameras. For instance, you can use a solenoid with a pin attached to the head to drag a tape forward to feed it. Actuators are an advanced topic and typically will require some modifications to the software to do what you want.

## Adding Actuators

## Head Offsets
TODO: See [Setting Head Offsets](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Setup-and-Calibration%3A-Nozzle-Setup#head-offsets) for the general process. It is basically the same for Actuators.
