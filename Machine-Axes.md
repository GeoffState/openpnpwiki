## The OpenPnP Coordinate System
OpenPnP conceptually uses a [Cartesian Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). Assuming you stand in front of the machine, the X axis points to the right, Y away from you and Z up. The rotational axis C rotates around Z, counter-clockwise.

The coordinate system now needs to be defined in OpenPnP. 

In the Machine Setup Tab hierarchical view, expand the Axes branch. Most likely you will already see defined axes, either migrated from an earlier version of OpenPnP or the default set.

Click on one of the existing ReferenceControllerAxis or create a new one using the ![Plus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/95689795-9f369b00-0c13-11eb-8347-7d4645776a0f.png) button and selecting the class:

### Properties

**Type** defines the axis meaning inside the Cartesian Coordinate System. OpenPnP can have multiple axes of the same Type, typically multiple Z and multiple C axes for multi-nozzle machines.

**Name** is your conceptual axis name. 

### Controller Settings

**Driver** links the axis to the driver which talks to the controller that controls its motion. 

**Axis Letter** gives you the letter of the axis by which it is addressed in the controller (usually a G-code letter). The letter must obviously be unique for a given driver. If you have multiple drivers, you typically have the same letter multiple times (and that is why inside OpenPnP you refer to the axis by its conceptual **Name** rather than its **Letter**). 

**Switch Linear â†” Rotational**: G-code controllers make a difference between linear and rotational axes. The difference is relevant for the correct interpretation of feed-rates, acceleration limits and other issues. If you have a machine with more than one controller and/or more than two nozzles, chances are high that you are forced to be using a linear controller axis (typically X Y Z) to move what is conceptually a rotational axis (A B C) or vice versa. 
OpenPnP needs to know if this is the case, so use the switch to toggle the axis meaning. 

**Home Coordinate** gives OpenPnP the initial coordinate after homing. This may include a retract distance. 

**Backlash Compensation** will be treated later, on the [[Backlash-Compensation]] page. For the first basic setup leave it at **None**. 

**Resolution [Driver Units]** indicates the smallest step that OpenPnP should consider as a change in coordinate, also sometimes named a resolution "tick". It should be equal to a micro-step (or a practical multiple thereof). The larger the Resolution tick is, the more often OpenPnP can optimize axis moves away (especially in the small adjustments of non.squareness compensation, nozzle tip runout compensation etc.). By preventing unneeded micro axis move, OpenPnP can also prevent extra backlash compensation moves (not relevant with DirectionalCompensation). 

### Kinematic Settings

**Soft Limit Low** and **Soft Limit High** bracket the valid range of the axis. OpenPnP will refuse a move to a Location if it leads outside this range. 

![Soft Limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/95889274-7e408800-0d82-11eb-9b45-d275c7d96874.png)

The resepctive Limit is only enforced if **Enabled?** is selected. 

![Capture Axis Limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/95889746-1c345280-0d83-11eb-8386-07d856e85958.png) Use the **Capture** button to capture the current axis position as the new limit.

![Position to Axis Limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/95889714-0e7ecd00-0d83-11eb-8945-e49f43e80d5b.png) Use the **Position** button to move the axis to its currently set limit. 

Within the soft limits, you can define the **Safe Zone Low** and **Safe Zone High** limits. This is mandatory for the Z axis, to define the so-called **Safe Z**. To avoid collisions with anything on the machine table, Nozzles and other Head-Mountables are lifted to **Safe Z** before the Head is allowed to move in X and Y. 

The **Safe Zone** can be the same value for **Low** and **High**, defining a single **Safe Z** height. Or it can be a range, to give OpenPnP more freedom to optimize its operation. There are the following considerations. 

Multi-nozzle machines often share one physical Z axis to make two Nozzles move in a counterweight, seesaw or rocker configuration (more on that later). If you want your **Safe Z** at the perfect balance-point of the two Nozzles, choose the mid-point of the Z axis as the **Safe Z** height, i.e. **Low/High** at the same value. However, if your Nozzles have a lot of Z headroom, it is quite slow to move them all the way to the balance-point. So you can choose individual **Safe Z** heights for the Nozzles and set them as the **Safe Zone Low** and **High** limits respectively (you will see which is which when you Jog them up and down). OpenPnP is then free to optmize and only lift the nozzle up as far as needed. Be prepared for the laid-back "hanging nozzle style". If there is a switch of nozzles, OpenPnP will even exploit the time in the trajectory across X/Y to move Z through the Safe Zone.
