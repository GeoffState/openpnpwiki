# Bottom Camera Setup
The Bottom Camera is a upward looking camera fixed to the machine, and not the head. The Bottom Camera is used during Bottom Vision processing to more accurately place parts. It's not required to have a Bottom Camera, but you will generally get better results if you do have one.

## Add a Camera
First, add a camera by following the instructions in [[General Camera Setup|Setup and Calibration: General Camera Setup]]. Make sure to configure each section before returning to this page to continue.

## Set Camera Location

## Move Nozzle to Camera
