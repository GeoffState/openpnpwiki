## Controllers and Firmwares for Advanced Motion Control

This page list Controllers and Firmwares that are known to be compatible with [[GcodeAsyncDriver]] and [[Advanced Motion Control]] features. Other controllers may also support the needed features, if you think your controller can do it, please [contact us in the user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openpnp). 

### Key Features

These are of course _in addition_ to basic homing and motion commands like [`G1`](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G0_.26_G1:_Move) etc.

1. The controller provides a [`M115`](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M115:_Get_Firmware_Version_and_Capabilities) firmware report command. This is used to automatically detect the type of the firmware in OpenPnP. Some automated setup can then be provided by the [[Issues and Solutions]] system. Even for a non-motion controller (e.g. a feeder control board) it is recommended to implement this as a minimum, to easily identify a controller on a port and to allow for [[automatic Issues & Solutions auto-setup|Issues-and-Solutions]]. 

The following requirements apply for controllers with axes attached:

2. The controller can manage extra axes (`A`, `B`, `C` etc.) as true axes, with simultaneous motion. Controllers/firmwares that only support multiplexing "extruder" `E` axes with `T` [tool select commands](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#T:_Select_Tool) are not valid. Any mixing of axes must be correctly supported, including all aspects of feed rate and acceleration limiting according to the [NIST RS274/NGC Interpreter â€“ Version 3 standard](https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-rs274ngc-interpreter-version-3), more specifically section "2.1.2.5 Feed Rate", or better. 

3. The controller can report axes positions, including extra axes (`A`, `B`, `C` etc.), typically with the [`M114`](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M114:_Get_Current_Position) command.

4. The controller can reset axes positions, including extra axes (`A`, `B`, `C` etc.), typically with the [`G92`](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G92:_Set_Position) command. 

5. `G92` must work correctly when motion is still pending. Either by implicitly waiting for still-stand or (better!) by allowing on-the-fly offsetting. 

6. The controller must be able to wait for motion completion, typically with the [`M400`](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M400:_Wait_for_current_moves_to_finish) command. Any further commands sent after the `M400` must be suspended until motion completion. The controller must only acknowledge the command, when motion is complete i.e. the "ok" response must be suspended until then, providing blocking synchronization to OpenPnP. 

7. The controller must support dynamic acceleration and/or jerk limits, typically by the [`M204`](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M204:_Set_default_acceleration) command for acceleration or the [`M201.3`](https://makr.zone/tinyg-new-g-code-commands-for-openpnp-use/577/) command for jerk.

## Smoothieware

A special Smoothieware firmware for OpenPnP is available. It contains some bug-fixes and features that are crucial for use with OpenPnP but are not present/accepted in the official Smoothieware firmware. The firmware and more details are available here:

* [makr.zone: "Smoothieware: New Firmware for PnP"](https://makr.zone/smoothieware-new-firmware-for-pnp/500/)

Refer to the Smoothieware Wiki on how to upgrade:

* [Flashing Smoothie Firmware](http://smoothieware.org/flashing-smoothie-firmware)

## Duet3D

The work to make [Duet3D 2/3 controllers](https://www.duet3d.com/index.php?route=common/home#products) ideal for OpenPnP is ongoing. More info will be made available here.

## Marlin 2.0

OpenPnP user Bill made a Marlin 2.0 port to Teensy 4.1 with advanced axis support. More information there:

## TinyG 

[TinyG](https://synthetos.com/project/tinyg) is often used for Pick & Place because it comes with the Liteplacer kit. Some features have been added to TinyG to make it more like other controllers and to optimize its use with OpenPnP. The firmware and more details are available here:

* [makr.zone: TinyG: New G-code commands for OpenPnP use](https://makr.zone/tinyg-new-g-code-commands-for-openpnp-use/577/).
* See the [proposed changes (Pull Request)](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/pull/258).
