# GcodeDriver Configuration

GcodeDriver is a universal driver for any controller that uses Gcode. It can even be used with controllers that don't use Gcode, as long as they accept basic text based commands. It is recommended that GcodeDriver be used whenever possible as it is the most advanced driver and receives constant improvement.

This page is intended to guide the reader through a basic GcodeDriver setup. For more advanced information, see [[the complete GcodeDriver reference|GcodeDriver]].
