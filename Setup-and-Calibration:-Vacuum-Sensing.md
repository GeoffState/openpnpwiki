Vacuum sensing allows OpenPnP to determine if a pick operation or a place operation has succeeded by checking the vacuum level through a pressure sensor.

OpenPnP currently has rudimentary support for vacuum sensing in the GcodeDriver. This feature will soon be expanded to be available for all drivers. If you are using GcodeDriver you can use it now.
