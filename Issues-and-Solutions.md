## What is it?
OpenPnP is complex to set up and the more flexibility and optimization is added, the more the complexity grows. In the course of developing and community testing the [[Advanced Motion Control]] it became apparent, that it is easier to program an automatism to _propose_ the proper setup than to document or communicate it.

Hence, the Issues & Solutions system was born. The OpenPnP Machine Setup now has a new tab on the machine that can be used to guide you through the process. The Issues & Solutions system has these features:

1. Detection of issues and (most of the time) proposal of a solution.
2. Lists issues from outright mistakes to suggestions for optimization.
3. The user is the boss: proposed solutions can be accepted or dismissed.
4. Accept solutions, explore them and undo them, if you don't like them.
5. Significantly lowers the required expertise of users. Solutions even generate machine-specific, ready-to-use Gcode commands and regular expressions.
6. Removes the last requirements for `machine.xml` hacking.
7. Each issue/solution is accompanied by an Info page, often linking to this Wiki.
