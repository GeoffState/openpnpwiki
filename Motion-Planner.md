## What is it?
The Motion Planner is the central entity planning and coordinating motion across drivers. In many respects it acts like one black-box that behaves as if it were one single driver. 

## Choosing a Motion Planner
The Motion Planner type can be chosen on the machine.

**CAUTION**: when you select a different type and press **Apply**, the specific settings of the former planner will be lost!

## NullMotionPlanner

**NullMotionPlanner** is the minimal planner selected by default. It is almost completely equivalent to how OpenPnP worked before the Motion Planner was introduced.

The NullMotionPlanner will execute moves one by one. It will wait for each move to complete, before allowing OpenPnP to go on. The machine will always move from complete still-stand in a straight line to complete still-stand, again. This is a very simple and robust model that is equally simple to understand. It is therefore still a valid and attractive choice for those who want to **keep it simple**.

Plus you can still use _some_ of the features offered by the [[Advanced Motion Control]] package, like better axis centric speed control and [[new GcodeDriver settings|Advanced-Motion-Control#gcodedriver-new-settings]].

## ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner

**ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner** is the motion planner that can do the things explained on the [[Advanced Motion Control]] page.

### Motion Interpolation

The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner can perform full 3rd order Motion Planning a.k.a. Jerk Control. However, most common controllers don't support this. Using time-stepped interpolation, the ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner can then still simulate Jerk Control on these constant acceleration controllers.

See the GcodeAsyncDriver's [[Interpolation settings|Advanced-Motion-Control#interpolation]].

### Motion Path Optimization

The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner will first just record the motion that OpenPnP wants to do. Nothing is planned or executed yet. At some point it will be a functional necessity for OpenPnP to make sure the machine is at the target location. One example is wanting to do Computer Vision, obviously the camera needs to be at the target location before it can take a picture. OpenPnP will then ask the Motion Planner to wait for motion completion, which triggers motion planning, execution and finally truly waiting for its completion. 

In the meantime there may have been several moves recorded, creating a motion path. The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner will now try to optimize how this path is executed. One thing the planner despises are corners (often 90Â° in OpenPnP). Corners mean the machine must come to a complete still-stand and then start accelerating from scratch. 

In OpenPnP, the typical application is the Move-to-Location-at-Safe-Z pattern. The Nozzle is down for a pick or place, then goes up to Safe Z, moves over the target location and then plunges down in Z to pick or place again. The NullMotionPlanner would generate the first rectangular path. The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner optimizes that path to look more like the second path. Because of the rounded, overshooting curves, the machine does not need to stop at any time. Instead, it can speed through the whole path in one fluid motion.

OpenPnP has the notion of a Safe Zone (see the [[Safe Zone axis limits|Machine-Axes#kinematic-settings--axis-limits]]) with no obstacles. The motion planners are free to "play" in this Safe Zone as they like. ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner uses this to let the Z axis overshoot, the the X/Y axis is already free to start moving, even before the Z axis has come to a stop. The same happens at re-entry, in reverse order. The planner can effectively overlap or blend the deceleration phase of Z with the acceleration phase of X/Y, hence the name "Motion Blending".

The actual result will be illustrated in the [Motion Planner Diagnostics](#motion-planner-diagnostics) section, below. 

## Motion Planner Settings

If you have the ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner selected, the **Motion Planner** tab will be available.
