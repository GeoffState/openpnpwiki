## What Should I Build?

See http://openpnp.org/hardware/ for a number of options. 

The current recommendation for a build guideline is:
* [DIY Pick and Place](https://hackaday.io/project/9319-diy-pick-and-place) for frame and X/Y.
* [ICEpick Direct Drive Head](https://github.com/BETZtechnik/ICEpick--Direct-drive-pick-and-place-head/wiki) for the head.
* [Quick Change Juki Nozzle Holders](http://www.betztechnik.ca/store/p32/Quick_change_Juki_nozzle_holders-_NEMA_8_5mm_OD_hollow_shaft-_STOCK.html) for nozzle holders and nozzles.
* [Smoothieboard](http://smoothieware.org/getting-smoothieboard) or [Cohesion3D](http://cohesion3d.com/cohesion3d-remix/) for motion control.
* [ELP 720p USB Cameras](http://www.elpcctv.com/hd-720p-usb-cameras-c-85_87.html) which can be purchased on Amazon, AliExpress and eBay. Lenses are standard M12 mount and can be replaced to customize for your machine's geometry.
* Yamaha CL Feeders (available on Aliexpress and [Robotdigg](https://www.robotdigg.com/product/829/CL82-or-CL84-Feeder-4-OpenPnP)) if you want auto feeders. Make sure to get a [mounting block](https://www.robotdigg.com/product/1190/Pick-and-place-machine-Feeder-mounting-block), too.
