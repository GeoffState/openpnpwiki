# Tape Strip Orientation

When setting the reference hole and second hole on ReferenceStripFeeder either manually or using Auto Setup, you have to choose your reference and second hole or part according to the standards used in SMT tape. Primarily this means that the reference hole should be the first hole 2mm from the first part in the direction of travel. The direction of travel is fixed, and is always north to south with the holes on the left. The tape can be in any orientation on the table but the direction of travel along the tape always follows this rule. See the image below for clairification:
