# What is it?

Computer Vision is used throughout OpenPnP to detect exactly where things are in relation to the cameras, sometimes to just determine _if_ they are there or not, and sometimes to read text (OCR) or codes (QR-Codes). Computer vision mostly uses a facility called Pipeline to perform the detection. The Pipeline is structured in so-called Stages that the user can configure in a special Pipeline Editor. 

This page is dedicated to explain some of the stages in more detail. The usage of the Pipeline Editor UI however is explained on the [[CvPipeline]] page.
