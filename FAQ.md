## How do I get help?

Check out https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Getting-Help for information on getting help and supplying good information.

## Where are configuration and log files located?

The configuration and log files are located in a subdirectory of your user's home directory called `.openpnp` (Version 1) or `.openpnp2` (Version 2).

To find your home directory, check out this Wikipedia article that explains where the home directory lives on various operating systems: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory

Examples:

```
Windows: C:\Users\your_username\.openpnp2
Linux: /home/your_username/.openpnp2
Mac OS X: /Users/your_username/.openpnp2
```

Configuration files are `machine.xml`, `parts.xml` and `packages.xml` along with other plugin specific files.

Log files are under the `log` subdirectory and the current file is always called `OpenPnP.log`.

If you double-click your camera view, a snapshot gets written to the `snapshots` subfolder.

Some Computer Vision pipelines also write debug images into various subfolders here.

## How do I reset my configuration?

Sometimes it's easiest just to completely reset your configuration and start over. To do that, just delete the whole OpenPnP configuration directory. See [Where are configuration and log files located?](#where-are-configuration-and-log-files-located) for it's location.


## How do I use a different config directory

It's possible to use command line argument for selecting the config directory, example below:

```
java -DconfigDir=src/main/resources/config -jar target/openpnp-gui-0.0.1-alpha-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## How do I turn on debug logging?

1. Select the Log tab from the main window.
2. Locate the Log Level dropdown.
3. Click the dropdown and select Debug or Trace, depending on how much output you want.

Note: Debug is good for general debugging. Trace is good for when you want very low level information such as Gcode commands being sent to the controller.

## How do I troubleshoot GcodeDriver?

See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#troubleshooting

## I'm having trouble connecting multiple USB cameras.

See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/USB-Camera-Troubleshooting-FAQ

## I need help configuring GcodeDriver.

See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#asking-for-help

## My nozzle moves (in Z) when the camera is moved.

## "It would be faster to do it by hand."

This comes up so often on the mailing list I thought it would be worth addressing as a FAQ. Often, when someone is talking about building a machine or discussing requirements, someone will comment with things along the lines of:

* "Running a pick and place is more work than you think."
* "For small runs it's faster just to do it by hand."
* "You will spend more time setting it up than using it."
* "It will cost you more in the end than just sending the work out, hiring someone, etc."

While some of these reasons might fit your situation, it is important to keep in mind that everyone has their own reasons for wanting to build a pick and place, and very often those reasons have nothing to do with time or money. Here are some other good reasons to build a pick and place machine, even if it's comparatively slow or costs a lot of money:

* Inability to place by hand due to age, illness, disability or disease.
* Live in a place where it's cost prohibitive or just impossible to send work out.
* Want to learn more about CNC, computer vision, pick and place, electronics assembly, etc.
* Just doing it for fun!
* Strange or complex jobs that contract assembly houses don't want to deal with.
* Want to try a new or novel idea for placing components.
* Any other reason you like!

It's okay to let people know about the complexities of running a machine, but I've found that this topic tends to come up over and over again and people seem to feel the need to really pound the point home that it might cost money or time to run the machine. Make your point, but remember that there are lots of reasons to run a machine other than just building boards for a business.

## What Should I Build?

This answer has been moved to the [[Build FAQ]].

## How can I improve placement accuracy?

Getting reliable, fast and accurate results is the ultimate goal but even for sophisticated machines quite a challenge to achieve all the time.

This guide tries to give an overview of the things to consider:

## OpenPnP is not working in Windows 7

Windows 7 is missing some libraries that OpenPnP relies on. If you can upgrade to Windows 10, that is the quickest solution. If that is not an option see [this Github comment](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/12010#issuecomment-420640169) about a possible solution, and [this discussion thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/openpnp/f14a436d-5b3e-4e21-b2cf-dee1f8222cd6%40googlegroups.com) for more information.
