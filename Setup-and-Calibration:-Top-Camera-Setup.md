# Top Camera Setup

## General Camera Setup (link to doc)
1. Add a New Camera
2. Set Rotation and Other Transforms
3. Set Units Per Pixel
4. Lens Calibration

## Set Camera Head

## Head Offsets (Recommend 0, link to general page on setting head offsets?)

## Camera Jogging
Now that the camera is configured, hold Shift and then Left Click within the camera view. The camera should move to the location you clicked on. This is called Camera Jogging and is the easiest way to move the machine around when setting things up.
