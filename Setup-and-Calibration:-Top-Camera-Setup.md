# Top Camera Setup

## Add a Camera

Whenever you are adding or configuring a camera, many of the steps are the same. See [[General Camera Setup|Setup and Calibration: General Camera Setup]] to get the basics and then return to this page for the steps specific to the Top Camera.

## Set Camera Head

In the Cameras tab, find the camera you configured above and look for the Head column in the table. Click the head field for your camera and select the head from the dropdown. You should only have one head, so select the only option in the list. 

## Head Offsets (Recommend 0, link to general page on setting head offsets?)

## Camera Jogging
Now that the camera is configured, hold Shift and then Left Click within the camera view. The camera should move to the location you clicked on. This is called Camera Jogging and is the easiest way to move the machine around when setting things up.
