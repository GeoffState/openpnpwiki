## This feature is not yet complete. This documentation is a work in progress.

Implemented in https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/226.

Download and print http://nerian.com/support/resources/patterns/pattern-letter.pdf. Make sure that the full pattern is visible on the page and there is some whitespace in the margins.

Mount the printed pattern to a piece of cardboard or stiff cardstock. It needs to stay relatively flat during the calibration process.
